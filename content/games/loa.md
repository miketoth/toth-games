## Outplay your opponents in epic team duels.

---

Legends of the Arena is a dueling game for two teams. As a team, coordinate your unique abilities to develop a strategy, but, in order to win, you must also anticipate your opponents' moves. No matter how far ahead or behind, you can always find a path to victory by outplaying your opponents!

* 1-9 players
* 20-40 minutes
* Ages 12+

## Epic team duels
  * Minimal downtime: each player participates in every combat
  * Incredible replay: every team composition has unique strengths  
  * No player is eliminated until the game is over

## Double-blind combat with diverse counterplay
  * Combat simulates dynamic, uncertain fights. Will your opponent charge or retreat? Feint or strike?
  * No randomness in combat: you must read the opponents' intentions to outplay them

## Radically asymmetric characters
  * Each character has unique cards and special abilities
  * Balanced matchups: every character or team can hold their own in any fight
